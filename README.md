#### Why Overture?
As customers' environmental awareness continues to rise, so does the demand for fashion brands that incorporate eco-friendly measures. However, existing e-commerce platforms offering sustainable clothing often face 3 disadvantages: limited inventory, lack of user-friendly features, and lack of exposure in the fashion ecommerce market. With Overture, we offer a platform that features **a large selection of items from various brands** and offers all the **user-friendly features**, so every user can find what they need on the platform rather than having to resort to less sustainable options.
